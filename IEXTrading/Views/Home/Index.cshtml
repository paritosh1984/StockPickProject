        Stock picking is an important ingredient for capital market investment success. There are several quantitative strategies namely EV-to-EBITDA (Enterprise Value to Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization ratio), Cash return on invested capital check, Return on Equity, 52-Week Price Range Strategy etc. to perform a health check for selecting a stock. For this project we have applied 52-week price momentum strategy to select the top five stocks.

    <h2>What is a '52-Week High/Low'</h2>
    <p>A 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price that a stock has traded at during the previous year. It is a technical indicator used by some traders and investors who view the 52-week high or low as an important factor in determining a stock's current value and predicting future price movement. As a stock trades within its 52-week price range (the range that exists between the 52-week low and the 52-week high), these investors may show increased interest as price nears either the high or the low.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>BREAKING DOWN '52-Week High/Low'</h2>
    <p>One use for the 52-week high/low figure is to help determine an entry or exit point for a given stock. For example, stock traders may buy a stock when the price exceeds its 52-week high, or sell when the price falls below its 52-week low. The rationale behind this strategy is that if price breaks out from the 52-week range (either above or below), there is enough momentum to continue the price move in the same direction.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Determining the 52-Week High/Low</h2>
    <p>The 52-week high/low is based on the daily closing price for stocks or indexes. Often, a stock may actually breach a 52-week high intra-day, but end up closing below the previous 52-week high, thereby going unrecognized. The same applies when a stock makes a new 52-week low during a trading session but fails to close at a new 52-week low, going unrecognized.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>52-Week Price Momentum Strategy</h2>
    <p>Price momentum simply refers to the speed with which a stock goes up or down over a given period of time. To quote William O’Neil, founder of Investor’s Business Daily, “The great paradox in the stock market is that what seems too high and risky to the majority usually goes higher and what seems low and cheap usually goes lower.”</p>
    <p>To measure price momentum, in the top-5 picking we considered the proximity of a stock to its 52-week high or low. The formula that we used to measure price momentum was: Price momentum = (Current price of a stock - 52 week low) ÷ (52 week high - 52 week low). Stocks that score 82% or higher on this formula tend to outperform, while stocks that score 41% or lower tend to underperform. In addition we have also added a condition to pick stocks that have average volume more than 30 million.</p>
